Habu Hacking Toolkit
====================

I'm developing Habu to teach (and learn) some concepts about Python and
Network Hacking.

Some techniques implemented in the current version are:

* ARP Poisoning
* ARP Sniffing
* DHCP Discover
* DHCP Starvation
* Fake FTP Server
* LAND Attack
* SNMP Cracking
* Subdomains Identification
* SSL/TLS Certificate Cloner
* SYN Flooding
* TCP Flags Analysis
* TCP ISN Analysis
* TCP Port Scan
* Username check on social networks
* Virtual Hosts Identification
* Web Techonologies Identification

The development of this software is supported by Securetia SRL (https://www.securetia.com/)
